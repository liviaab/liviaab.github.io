**Hi! :)**

This is my personal website project and it was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

I am trying to learn more about React, mobile-first and responsive design. For example, I am making the styles work for different screen sizes but it does not work for all the orientations yet. I am also using Sass and CSS modules to take advantage of several things they can give to us as variables, mixins, media queries and scoped classes.

I am using the [Atomic Design](https://github.com/danilowoz/react-atomic-design) to build the pages and components because it is a great method to organize the project

There are no tests for the components because most of them have no behavior.

## Running

In the project directory, you can use yarn scripts to start, test, build and deploy the project:

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
